# Overview
https://qojav.github.io/java-developer-roadmap/languages/en/phase1/
This is a final project for my phase 1 of learning Java, the idea was to apply things that i've learned as much as i could, I will probably revisit this a couple of times, add more features, refactor here and there(I should use more stream API), till i am happy with the end product(Will probably never happen).
